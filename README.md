# ESS490-590-Spr21
Spring 2021 Data Science for Earth and Planetary Systems

## Summary
Introduction to Data Science for Earth and Planetary Systems (surface processes, natural hazards, geochemistry, physics of the Earth interior). Teaches basics in computing skills in python; data manipulations, visualization, curation; data statistics, clustering; regression analysis, neural networks; applied explicitly to data encountered in Earth and Planetary Systems.
# Learning objectives
Quantitative data analysis is becoming a necessary skill for most geoscientists. The course is designed to provide hands-on experience with fundamental data science techniques applied to geoscientific data. The learning outcomes will be basics in:
- Computing: python, notebooks, version control, cloud, and local platforms.
- Data manipulation in Geosciences:  data formats, plotting, dimensionality reduction, and feature engineering.
- Statistical methods applied to geoscience data.
- Open science, reproducibility, and digital scholarship
Students will learn by practicing.
**Prerequisites**: MATH 207 and MATH 208, or MATH 307 and 308, or AMATH 351 and 352, or permission from the instructor.
**Recommended**: knowledge in Matlab or python, AMATH301, a college-level Earth Sciences course
